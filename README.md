# maze-project
Building a maze game using raycasting and SDL2 as a portfolio project. 
Development features include:
- Creating a window with SDL2
- Using raycasting to draw walls on your window
- Making the color of walls different from the color of the - ground/ceil
- Drawing walls facing NORTH and SOUTH in a different color from walls facing EAST and WEST.
- Providing means to rotate the camera during the execution for by using the left,right arrows keyboard presses or mouse movements
- Providing a way to move the camera during execution for example by using w,a,s,d keyboard presses.
- Implementing collisions and maps

- Handling the collisions of the player with the walls. The player must not be able to enter a wall but can slide on the walls instead of being just stopped by it.
- implementing a parser to get the map from a file and define characters for different components (walls, enemies, space etc)
- Drawing the map and including the playerâ€™s line of sight in it.

Implementing extra features
- Add textures to walls as well as the ground
